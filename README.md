# Coursera_Capstone
My project in IBM data science course

Week 1 : Contain a tester file

Week 2 : Learn Foursquare API

Week 3 : Learn KMeans Clustering

Week 4 : Battle of Neighborhood 1

Week 5 : Battle of Neighborhood 2

Battle of Neighborhood is a data science capstone project in IBM Data Science Proffesional Certification
I am tasked to create a data science project involving spatial visualization (Folium), spatial analysis (KMeans), and scraping spatial data using Foursquare API

The topic I picked is analyzing Airbnb dataset, because it reminded me of my previous project which I thought could be improved if I could make use of location information.

This repository include my files from previous projects (airbnb_project.ipnyb) and new projects from coursera capstone course.
